## 1. Paragraphs

You can write your paragraph normally.
It means, you don't wanna put/code any special things for it.

Think like this,
If you wanna line break from here.
So, you have to give 2 spaces and hit enter to that.Like this. (space x 2)  
Now, you saw it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

After a paragraph,  
If you wanna write a new paragraph,  
Then go to the next line & Just type normally.  
(Don't forget to make an empty line between that 2 paragraphs.  
That empty line'll separate your paragraphs from a empty line.)

It's so easy...üòä

## 2. Headings

It's easy too.

1st thing is you have to put the "#" symbol for that. Like this;

Ex:- # This is a Heading

Then you can get a heading. And important thing is, this heading styling is so similar to HTML headings.  
Why? Using that "#" you can get different size headings.

Ex:-  
#Heading1

# Heading 1

##Heading 2

## Heading 2

###Heading 3

### Heading 3

###Heading 4

### Heading 4

####Heading 5

#### Heading 5

#####Heading 6

##### Heading 6

######Heading 7

###### Heading 7

So, that's how it's working. You have to put "#" symbol multiple times for that.  
(Try it with your own hands. Then you'll get it üêí)

## 3. Bold

If you wanna turn something into **bold** .  
You have to add "**\*\***" OR "**\_\_**(double underscore)" for left end & right end of a word or tense.  
Like this;

**Ex**:-

- This is **bold**, you can **see** it too.
- **You did it buddy...**

Sometimes, that underscore method is not working well.  
So, use \*\* for your decorations.

See...? It's easy to learn...ü§©

## 4. Italic

If you wanna turn something into _Italic_ .  
You have to add "**\***" OR "**\_**(double underscore)" for left end & right end of a word or tense.  
Like this;

**Ex**:-

- This is a _cat_.

## 5. Strike through

I know, some times you wanna make a strike on your word/sentences.
So, let's learn it too.

You have to, use "~~" symbol for that. Put them twice.  
Like this "~ ~ Samantha ~~".  
(Don't make spaces between that " ~~")

**Ex**:-

- Don't forget the ~~words~~.
- ~~Samantha~~

## 6. Highlights

I know, know...  
Sometimes we all need to <mark>highlight</mark> our words/tenses too.

For this, you have to use a HTML TAG.  
It's called **mark** tag.

**Ex**:-

- I'm < mark>Invincible</ mark>.
- I'm <mark>Invincible</mark>.

üëÜüèª You can use **"mark"** tag like that & decorate.
